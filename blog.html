            <strong>seasson storage </strong>
            The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage
            object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to
            localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage
            doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page
            session ends.
            <strong>local storage </strong>
            Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to
            the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored
            across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
            localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is
            when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab
            of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a
            private browsing or incognito session).

              what is difference of global scope and block scope in javascript
            </strong>
            Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope Scope. ES6
            introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables
            declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the
            block:

            <strong> what is event loop in javascript</strong>
            We’ll start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async
            JavaScript code (like the setTimeout we just discussed), until ES6,
            JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of
            asynchronicity built into it. The JavaScript engine has never done
            anything more than executing a single chunk of your program at any
            given moment.

            <strong>how to get Undefined</strong>
            Undefined is returned when nothing is returned from the object or if
            the object or array contains nothing. A variable that has not been
            assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
            returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not
            have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was
            not returned.
